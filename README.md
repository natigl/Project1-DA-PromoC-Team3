In this repository you will find how we have cleaned and merged the information that was provided to us in different csv. This is where we put into practice the most basic knowledge of Python.

We worked with txt and xml files, opening, parsing and cleaning the data.

For them, we have worked with functions, for loops, string and list methods among others.

In addition, we have created a SQL database to be able to enter all our data and have them well organized.
